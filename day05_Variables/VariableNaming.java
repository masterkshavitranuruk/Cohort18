//		All variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet, an
//		underscore, or ( _ ), or a dollar sign ($).  The convention is to 
//		always use a letter of the alphabet.
//		• After the first initial letter, variable names may also contain
//		letters and the digits 0 to 9. No spaces or special characters are
//		allowed.
//		• The name can be of any length, but don't get carried away.
//		Remember that you will have to type this name.
//		• Uppercase characters are distinct from lowercase characters. 
//		Using ALL uppercase letters are primarily used to identify
//		constant variables.  Remember that variable names are
//		case-sensitive.
//		• You cannot use a java keyword (reserved word) for a variable
//		name.
//		• Use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations it will make your
//		code self-documenting
//		• If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word
//		in all lowercase letters. If it consists of more than one word, 
//		capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word(camelCased).
